            <p class ="explain">How we formed: </p>
            <p>The club formed during the Covid lockdowns of 2020 and 2021, when people were stuck at home and had nothing to do, so what better way to pass the time via a fun competitive game of balloon keepy uppy!! The students of MTU then decided to form this club so that students can enjoy this exciting game together. Recently other universities have followed suit so there will also be competitions availible for those to want to prove their keepy uppy skills and represent MTU.</p>
